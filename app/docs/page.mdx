# Documentation

Welcome to the `@protoworx/react-ripple-effect` documentation. This library provides a lightweight, hook-based event bus for React that enables decoupled communication between components.

## What is @protoworx/react-ripple-effect?

`@protoworx/react-ripple-effect` is a tiny event bus system for React applications. It allows components to communicate with each other through named events without direct dependencies, making your codebase more modular and maintainable.

### Key Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size with zero dependencies
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support for event names and data
- **Hook-Based**: Simple React hooks API (`useTriggerEvent` and `useMonitorEvent`)
- **Decoupled**: Components can communicate without knowing about each other
- **Flexible**: Support for async callbacks, debouncing, throttling, and more

## Quick Start

Get started in just a few steps:

### 1. Install the Package

```bash
npm install @protoworx/react-ripple-effect
```

### 2. Setup the Event Provider

Wrap your app with the `EventProvider`:

```tsx
"use client";

import {
  EventDriver,
  EventProvider,
} from "@protoworx/react-ripple-effect";

const client = new EventDriver();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <EventProvider client={client}>
      <YourComponents />
    </EventProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Trigger and Monitor Events

Use the hooks to trigger and listen for events:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useTriggerEvent, useMonitorEvent } from "@protoworx/react-ripple-effect";

// Trigger an event
function Button() {
  const trigger = useTriggerEvent();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => trigger("button-clicked", { id: 123 })}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}

// Monitor an event
function EventLogger() {
  useMonitorEvent({
    "button-clicked": (data) => {
      console.log("Button clicked!", data);
    },
  });
  return <div>Listening for events...</div>;
}
```
